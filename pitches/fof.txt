TENTATIVE HOLD ME:
 - lyric video
 - more photos
 - mix tweaks down
 - mastered
 - album art


What Surfer Dave would like ideally:
 1. hold me, closer, forever all through fof
    alternative: do hold me, see how it goes, then do the next 2
 2. 1+ sd solo beat tapes through fof
 3. 1+ sd collab tapes through fof (somni, shrimpnose, daedelus, harris cole, etc)


What Criibaby want:
 1. 3 eps through fof
 2. live shows with label mates
 3. collabs with label mates
 4. marketing budget


How describe:
 - neo soul songs with modern lofi production (shlohmo x badu)


What do we want from label:
 - we want someone to get behind the music
   - outreach to new places
   - marketing and pr plus playlisting
   - as opposed to alphapup, with whom we would just be another artist getting distro
 - collab with other members ofthe label
   - because the roster is rad
   - we are super open to collabs
 - less important, we also want to collab and release other tapes through them



Timeline:
 -           hold me                    closer                     forever
 - early:    october 2021               may 2022                   october 2022
 - late:     january 2022               may 2022                   october 2022

 - i just really don’t want forever released in 2023
 - we can have our part done by end of september

FROM HIM:
 - cbb: more subtle messaging
   - less of the underdog role
   - lead with the art
 - not ready
   - not into the trilogy
   - instead focus on an ep

 - bring in collaborators

 - clementine 
   - fuckin incredible
 - infinitely
   - hit song
   - but too meandering and ballady
 - better things
   - demo
 - care
   - awesome
 - slow motion
   - awesome
 - hurt
   - needs work on production side
   - use percs early, then picking up throughout song
 - untitled
   - demoey


THE AGREEMENT
 - 50 50 after expenses are recouped
   - nobody gets anything until the advance for marketing is recovered
   - across the board, every artist gets same deal
 - distro with K7 out of berlin and london
 - there is sync pitching
 - we’d agree on the budget right off the bat
 - does not do 1 off albums
   - for thisn: prolly be similar to afternoon bike ride deal
     - EP + LP (ep and lp mando, label option for 2nd lp (includes advance))
 - start with a deal memo
   - once it’s approved, fof lawyer drafts the real contract


NOTES
 - terrabird media, cool PR company, check it out
 - bbc6 might be cool for some of these tracks
 - we get put on tester playlists
   - if we do well and skip rate is low, the algorithm likes us more
 - nobody pays attention first release
 - whole strategy is hedging the bets
   - we know no one cares
   - 10 times the audience needs to hear the material
     - just takes time, good material and consistency
 - v h v h still valuable
 - there might be a lyrical direction suggested
 - artist retreat
   - have a bunch of label friends to just come and hang


Qs:
 - current song breakdown 
   - ep is close, some songs are demoey
     - care, clem, slo mo, hurt
     - possibly circles, maybe some others
     - 2-3 singles, 4-6 songs


DOs:
 - put together first ep vision on our own
   - note what work needs to be done
   - go back and retool with good arrangement in mind
   - keep stuff over 2 minutes if we really believe in it
     - 2 to 3.5 range if possible
   - coffee shop soul thing
 - decide on mf how we’re marketing the duo
