HOW TO WASH THAT SH*


TO DO


THINGS I’LL DO
 - buy cpu
 - buy software and cpu components
 - probably drop the bulk of it in savings


EASY IDEAS
 - buy analog gear that will hold its value for more yrs
 - give a percent to a charitable org


AGGRESSIVE IDEAS
 - can i buy plugin subscriptions and have people pay me back with non-direct payments? ie food, other expenses, studio purchases, slack from collaborative costs, ious, cash, and more?
 - maybe hire dad and have him pay me back with a present or donation or xmas?
 - maybe hire jae and have her pay me back in the form of groceries and commodities?
 - hire somebody else
 - invest in a friend’s business
 - immediately invest in a remodel/build
