Passive switcher
 - all we need is a little switch and a few jacks. That plus a basic enclosure and we can do it
 - potentially also a clean volume? like a nice linear actuator to output
   - it should be a 100k knob, that’s line level evidently


Designated pad for eqs and whatnot
 - commandeer old used pad
 - take a designated out and throw it into the pad. Probably keep a vu meter app or spectrograph or stereo image item in there


Couple controller faders
 - I don’t know how precisely to do this but it would be fantastically useful
 - JLCPCB: sick super cheap circuitboard prototype builder


Touchscreen console
 - we can buy an attachable screen and pair it with an old hi def monitor
 - pretty easy except we can only use 1 touch point at a time, partially defeats the purpose of a mixing console exposed


Midi controller #1: two knobs for compressor control (gain and threshold)
 - start with just trying to configure mapping the knobs we have to plugin control first
 - Basic:
   - 2 knobs. This would be absolutely sick for humanizing compression plugins
   - 2 knobs, 2 linear potentiometers
     - maybe 2 fading lamps for hotness
 - Bigger:
   - 4 knobs, input, threshold, attack, release
     - model it as the 1176 format
     - maybe 1 more knob for ratio?
 - hairless for serial to midi
