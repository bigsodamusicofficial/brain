IDEA: the surfer dave jazz band
 - we play surfer dave arrangements as jazz songs
 - use a compressor to sidechain instruments live
 - sometimes invite guest vocalists


LINEUP
 - 1 drum man
 - 1 guit man
 - 1 keys man (who?)
 - I play the bass (wow bassist as band leader very cool)


WHAT I NEED
 - i will find a keyboardist
 - get new transcription notebook for surfer dave only
 - identify and write out jazzable surfer dave joints
 - maybe to practice upright?
