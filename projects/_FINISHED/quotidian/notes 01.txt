Mix notes me:

Sleepwalkin
 - cut a lil low mids outta main Vox
 - idea: telephone voice a bit before bass drops?
 - turn up harp right at end of chorus

Ebb n flow
 - try to comp Vox a lil more to get a bit more excitement outta em
 - needs like 2 more transitions at weak points

Loopty
 - a lil too much verb on voice before drop
 - verb also too long (kinda way too long)
 
New shag carpet
 - there’s a guy in the Vox mids that bugs me
 - automate drum volume more, more excitement during transitions

Specs
 - P vox might be a tad hot
 - automate drums way up during tildes’s drop

Creature comforts
 - first verse too quiet
 - more snap on the kick, let it rule
 - thunk snare too loud and sticking out, process him somehow. Comp?

Day in
 - turn p Vox up a touch
