Care 

Damn that sounds good shit 



“You don’t” BG vox on hook can come up in volume I think? 



But also “cuz” / “ you don’t” lead into hook2 can be cleaned up just a tad like maybe put the “you don’t” @ even lower freq to make it WUSHHIER / dampened 



Clem

Beginning too simple … needs consciously produced beginning 

Thickness… more in the verse 

V2 we know there needs to be more - can’t take so long to get interesting 



Busy ness in hook2 - can you pan me more and push me back 

The outro tho!!! 

Add SHUNK pluggy inny sound, rec using Millenia 



Hurt 

Piano intro Still high end issues - hurty notes for me will help with removing shrillness factor (could also consider using real piano or the new piano plugin) 

Still not QUITE happy with production 

Louder vox?? Am I getting drowned? 

Guit (or piano?)on first hook kinda too big then goes away 



JAE ADD MORE HARMS - fine fine fine 



Midsection - less volume … good tension built but too loud in comparison to the verse 



Very end, Mute one of the delays- piano guy? Silence is key for tension 



Cold 

Have we solved the need for an interlude with this long intro or should we even split the intro into an actual separate track in case peeps wanna get right to it like sorta a radio edit idk I just wonder if we are doing ourselves a disservice at all with a long intro maybe get Leeor’s feedback 

Up the new harm guy 

Bring down the vol increase into the verse - esp the bass 



Nirvana guy that we put on rooster has a couple sticky outy notes, let’s calm him down a little - turn vol down on those big swells 



Up the volume in the outro/ transition better?



Mom said this is my Radiohead song lol I told you those outro swells are Jonny Greenwood as fuck 🙌  



Home 



Take out sine hurty guys that are present at loud vol … while song should be really mellow and soothing 

JAE ADD HARMS 



Separate harms- can’t find individual old harms 



JAE retake short notes in hook - fatten “I’m” “GO-” “in’” “home” BGV be more intentional 



Lead up to hook? Some kinda thingy near the “I’m goin?”



like the vox harms tease early on !! 



Also like the new plucky acoustic guitar ooo



ADD HARP???? Like arpeggio deal… Swell.. Make it a bigger build into the “I’m comin home” outro (not EPIC just lush and full and satisfying) it’s the end of the record 



Make outro piano real piano or take off a lot of high end or use that one piano we’re gonna download???
