TITLE? HOld me?


TRACKLIST
 - care
 - clementine
 - hurt
 - cold
 - home


TO DO
 - tune snare in home, seems to hi pitched
 - work on intro of hurt, i still don’t like melody in there
 - get a dank percussion person on clementine, or do it my damn self
 - after we have some idea of what is happening, take a pass at charlay’s to bring color in missing spots


IDEAS
 - this is tentative, i guess we’ll see if this is what we’re doing
