IDEAS
 - possible direction: schwaomp x sd type beat (sd instuments with schwaomp timing)
 - get tons of feats
   - like basically a feat on every song. That way every song has an exciting and diverse voice
 - make everything rich, warm jazz
 - lots of time changes
 - maybe make 2 tapes? keep ljv a pretty, melodic full-fledged compositional beat tape and make a tape of shorty loops
 - maybe run borg 10 end into grate 001 intro?
   - maybe this is the end of the tape?



INSPO
 - more melodies like borg 010. sensitive, gentle, romantic
 - extremely deep sidechain, narrow chords. non quant. be me
