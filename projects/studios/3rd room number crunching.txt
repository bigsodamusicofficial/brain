3RD ROOM
 - the three options for starting a 3rd studio room are as follows:
   0. We don’t. Maybe it’s better to focus real hard on the current 2 rooms rather than split the bill further
   1. We execute the original plan:
      - stack up current studio to critical mass
      - start up another room to alleviate pressure
      - timing/rent options for this plan:
        1a. We peel people off of the current 2 rooms
        1b. We split rent all the way across for both buildings and everybody can access either room
        1c. We do a hybrid, some people can access both rooms and thus pay more rent, some people stay just only residents of the current space
   2. Me and P and 1 other person (Tilden?) peel off and grab a cabin in the woods
      - this involves more bread on my part
   3. Jarron decides to leave next year and we take over his space
   4. We move to a bigger space

 - THE TABS:
   0.  200x6 = 1200
       200x7 = 1400, subtract 100 each from Paloma and Jarron
       175x8 = 1400, subtract 100 each still
   1.  200x8 = 1600 - 1200 = 400. We’d have to add somebody else to make it work. But is 9 past critical mass?
   2.  My rent goes to about 500. 200 from Berkeley Q and 300ish estimated for the next Q
   3.  Total rent next year: 3500
       1100 for paloma
       2400 (1600 is covered max. This involves an 800 difference)
       2400/8 = 300. Doable?
   4.  250*8 = 2000 + ~200 = 2200
       200*9 = 1800 + ~200 = 2000
       300*8 = 2400 + ~200 = 2600

THE PLAN
 - carry out 1a. Stack to mass currently, and if there’s an issue of people needing more time we broach the 3rd room issue.
 - once we get cpu updated, I’ll be able to take a clone drive and/or ilok over to charlay’s and work there for part of the time. That could take a teeny bit of pressure off the main building
   - maybe this could actually happen earlier: we get that clone of 10.9 and run up over there. This has to be post ilok so I can put soundtoys licenses back over there


THOUGHTS:
 - idea: ask all the relevant members whether they would rather split rent up or set aside the extra 200 for a preamp fund
 - according the the last monthish of calendar, it’s mostly p and I in the dang rooms all the dang time. I always need a place to produce and he always needs a place to track vox. Ideally we’d have another place to do both really peacefully and easily
 - we could find out who’d be willing to participate in 1c. That improves our budget data
 


Needs of everyone:
 P
  - vox finals
 Jae
  - vox finals
 Cope
  - vox finals
  - production
  - mix
 Marco
  - production
 Zack
  - production
  - practice
 Me
  - production
  - mix
  - master

 
 Monk
  - production
 Tilden
  - vox finals
  - production
  - mix

 Another producer
  - production

Tally: 
 Vox finals:  3 ~ 4
 Production:  4 ~ 7
 Mix:         2 ~ 3
 Master:      1

Production peel off: Zack, monk, me
Vox peel off: P, tilden
