TO DO
 - find out how many cpus can be registered on slate license
 - inquire with peeps about combining forces to get a couple extra license subs


THE PLAN
 - get trashcan that can run 10.9, use my ilok with that guy
 - trashcan should natively run 10.14.6 (pt perpetual minimum)
   - eventually get slate and slowly move things over to native trashcan rather than external hd
     - involves buying plugs one at a time
 - the tab for slate and pt subscriptions:
   - (12.5 + 30)/6 = 7.08
   - (12.5 + 30)/8 = 5.31
