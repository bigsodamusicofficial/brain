=== 7/26 for 1.01 from client

They sound really different to me. 

1. The transitions are sounding quite different. In the way the sound effects are constructed. The reference has more anticipation, movement, landing with more balance between bass-mid-high.
2. The reference feels like it has a lot more balance between bass-mid-high. The whooshes etc are not sounding the same.
3. The radial wipes sound like a totally different sound effect. 
4. Is the “room tone” in there?

Also, feel to try a different track if it makes this easier.

Do you want the protools session for the references?

There's a few things that stand out to my ears. In general I don't feel the
weight of the whoosh throughs, around 1:35 gets the closest to the Mock Up
in my opinion. It also feels like there's some elements missing (such as
the rotary thing in the background around 19 seconds). I think it's missing
SFX coverage, and the mix doesn't feel full-bodied enough. It feels like
the sound elements are just being dropped in - rather than designed and
married together.

Also, I know you said just to examine the SFX, I can hear soooo much mouth
noise in the DX (clicky and smacky) - and it feels a little harsh to me.
