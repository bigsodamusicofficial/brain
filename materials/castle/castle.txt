CASTLE
 - I want a castle



ATTRIBUTES OF THE CASTLE:
 - hard, flat surfaces
 - big, good, high-definition art
 - spacious spaces
 - many rooms (at least 3 rooms (as defined by each having its own closeable door))
 - sattelite areas (front yard or patio or balcony or roof access (or other small satelite altogether))
 - window with dominating view
 - feeling of structural/spacial security
   - go into a door, then another door, then another door
 - big furniture



THE PLAN TO ACQUIRE A CASTLE
 1. move to next house as lowering of overhead
 2. accumulate savings, art, furnishings, clothes, and construction/mainenance techniques
 0. PUT THIS PLAN TO REST FOR A WHIE. KEEP THIS RUNNING PASSIVELY. ART AND CRAFT AND SKILL IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
 3. rent for as little time as humanly possible
 4. purchase 1st castle
 5. fully rent out 1st castle (WITH FRIENDS) and buy 2nd castle
 6. live large in 2nd castle if not 3rd castle



LANDMARK GOALS
 - FIRST MONETARY GOAL: 60k in checking + savings (this equates to 5 years of rent)
   - this goal most comfortably lies beyond current income, it lies in commission projects, one offs, big checks, music revenue, sales, schemes.
   - but if we were working toward this by chiseling off designated income:
     - 100/mo = 50yrs
     - 200/mo = 25yrs
     - 1000/mo = 5yrs
     - 3k/mo = 2yrs
 - FIRST INCOME GOAL: 4k NET/mo (after stu/food/gas spending, not including rent)
   - current progress:
     - 800/mo from radio
     - 800/mo from sz/ew
     - remaining: 2400/mo
